<h2>Module Project: Brainstorming Innovative Projects with ChatGPT</h2>

<h4>Objective:</h4>

<p>The primary goal of this assignment is to brainstorm innovative project ideas that leverage the capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4. By using the ChatGPT website, you will engage with the model to come up with at least three compelling project ideas that harness the potential of these advanced language models in various domains.</p>

<h4>Prerequisites:</h4>

<ul>
<li>An internet connection to access the ChatGPT website.</li>
<li>A method to document your ideas (Google Docs, Markdown, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps:</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Get Familiar with ChatGPT</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the ChatGPT website and engage in some initial interactions to understand its capabilities and limitations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Select a Domain</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Decide on a general domain you are interested in for your project (e.g., healthcare, sustainability, automation).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Brainstorming Session</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Use ChatGPT to brainstorm potential project ideas within your chosen domain.</li>
<li>Pose questions to the model like, "What are some unique ways to use AI in healthcare?" or "How could machine learning improve public transportation?"</li>
<li>Take notes during the brainstorming session for later review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Idea Refinement</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Choose at least three project ideas that interest you.</li>
<li>Engage with ChatGPT to explore these ideas in more depth.
<ul>
<li>For example, ask, "What would be the steps to use AI for real-time language translation in emergency services?"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Document each of your selected ideas, outlining:
<ul>
<li>The problem the project aims to solve</li>
<li>How modern LLMs like ChatGPT could be utilized in the solution</li>
<li>The data and resources you think you'll need</li>
<li>Limitations and challenges of the idea</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Peer Review (stretch goal)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Share your documented ideas with classmates for a review and gather constructive feedback.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Refinement</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Refine your ideas based on the peer feedback received.</li>
<li>Make necessary adjustments before the final submission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Submission</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Submit your well-documented project ideas for evaluation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4>Evaluation Criteria:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Innovation and creativity</li>
