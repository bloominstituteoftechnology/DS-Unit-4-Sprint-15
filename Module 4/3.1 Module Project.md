### Module Project: Building an Advanced Local LLM Bot

#### Objective:

The main goal of this assignment is to develop a local LLM bot with customizable prompts and parameters. As a stretch goal, you will implement a short-term memory model for the bot, allowing for more coherent and context-aware interactions.

#### Prerequisites:

- Python programming experience
- Basic understanding of machine learning, NLP, and LLMs
- Access to an LLM API or local setup

#### Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**
    - Set up a basic bot using a local LLM or an API service.

2. **Experimentation**
    - Experiment with various prompts and parameters to understand their impact on the bot's responses.

3. **Refactoring**
    - Refactor your bot into a function or class, making sure to parameterize the `user_prompt`.

4. **Memory Module (Stretch Goal)**
    - Implement a memory system for your bot. This can range from simply feeding back previous interactions to a more complex approach like a vector database for automatic relevant recall.

5. **Evaluation**
    - Evaluate the bot's performance in terms of coherence, relevance, and context-awareness.

6. **Documentation**
    - Document your design choices, implementation details, and observations.

7. **Peer Review (Stretch Goal)**
    - Share your project for peer review, focusing on the bot's design, performance, and memory model.

8. **Final Submission**
    - Submit your code and documentation for evaluation.

#### Evaluation Criteria:

- Quality of the design and implementation of the bot
- Effectiveness of the parameterization and customization
- Implementation and performance of the memory model (if attempted)
- Peer review feedback (optional)

#### Resources:

- LLM API documentation
- Research papers on short-term memory models in bots
- Guided Project: Vector Databases for Long Term LLM Memory
