## OpenAI API Basics

## Setting Up OpenAI's Python SDK
The OpenAI API provides a way to programmatically interact with their models for various tasks like text generation, summarization, and more. OpenAI provides an SDK for Python that wraps the API, offering a more Pythonic way to make requests to the GPT models.

### Prerequisites

To work with the OpenAI Python SDK, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or higher (3.11+ recommended)
- OpenAI account
- API key from OpenAI

### Installation

Installing the OpenAI Python SDK is simple. Use pip to install the package:

```shell
pip install openai
```

### Initializing SDK

To use the OpenAI SDK in your Python code, you need to import it and initialize it with your API key.

#### API Key Configuration

After obtaining your API key from OpenAI, you can set it up in one of two ways:

1. Environment Variable: Set an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the key as its value.
2. Directly in Code: Pass the API key as an argument while initializing the SDK. This is far less secure and NOT recommended.

### Simple Example: Text Translation

Here's a quick example to generate text using the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI SDK:

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

text = "Welcome to Data Science"
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="gpt3.5-turbo",
    prompt=f"Translate the following English text to French: '{text}'",
    max_tokens=60
)

generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(generated_text)
```

In this example, the text generated will be the French translation of the English text specified in the `text` variable.
