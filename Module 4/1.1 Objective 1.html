<h2>OpenAI API Basics</h2>

<h2>Setting Up OpenAI's Python SDK</h2>

<p>The OpenAI API provides a way to programmatically interact with their models for various tasks like text generation, summarization, and more. OpenAI provides an SDK for Python that wraps the API, offering a more Pythonic way to make requests to the GPT models.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>To work with the OpenAI Python SDK, you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python 3.9 or higher (3.11+ recommended)</li>
<li>OpenAI account</li>
<li>API key from OpenAI</li>
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Installing the OpenAI Python SDK is simple. Use pip to install the package:</p>

<pre><code>pip install openai
</code></pre>

<h3>Initializing SDK</h3>

<p>To use the OpenAI SDK in your Python code, you need to import it and initialize it with your API key.</p>

<h4>API Key Configuration</h4>

<p>After obtaining your API key from OpenAI, you can set it up in one of two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Environment Variable: Set an environment variable called <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> with the key as its value.</li>
<li>Directly in Code: Pass the API key as an argument while initializing the SDK. This is far less secure and NOT recommended.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Simple Example: Text Translation</h3>

<p>Here's a quick example to generate text using the GPT-3 model via the OpenAI SDK:</p>

<pre><code>import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"

text = "Welcome to Data Science"
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="gpt3.5-turbo",
    prompt=f"Translate the following English text to French: '{text}'",
    max_tokens=60
)

generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(generated_text)
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the text generated will be the French translation of the English text specified in the <code>text</code> variable. </p>
